# HealthTech Use Cases (Arc + x402)

This document is the **behavioral contract** for payment-gated flows in this repo: **Clinical Arc** NHS APIs (`/api/nhs/*`), integrations (AgentMail, HTTP pay notes, etc.), and **legacy** event/dance scaffolds (`/dance-extras`, battle/coaching) that demonstrate the same **HealthTech Protocol** patterns on Arc Testnet + x402.

## Interaction modes (humans & agents)

**HealthTech Protocol** stays **one** contract: payments and API access are governed by **Arc Testnet settlement** + **x402**. Colloquial pairings (human↔human, human↔agent, agent↔human, agent↔agent) describe **who authorizes** and **who benefits**, not four different protocol specs.

- **Human ↔ human** — Wallet-funded commerce between people/orgs (battles, passes, royalties). Primary flows in §1–§10 below.
- **Human → agent (orchestrated)** — A human approves spend; an agent or script **calls the same `POST /api/...` routes** (e.g. from MCP, CI, or an assistant). The signing wallet is usually still the user’s unless you implement delegation or server-side treasury.
- **Agent → human** — Backend or paid job **delivers** to a person (email, SMS, pass state). Example: tournament ops bot + AgentMail after a `charge`.
- **Agent → agent** — **Machine-to-machine**: server keys, HMAC, or **x402** between services; overlaps with “machine payments” in x402. This repo often uses **wallet x402 to this backend**, then **Bearer/API-key** upstream (e.g. AgentMail) to avoid inbox scope issues.

When testing, default to **Arc testnet** and treat **402** responses as “payment required”—whether the client is a browser or an automated caller that can complete the challenge per your security model.

## Scope

- **Third-party gateways:** Integrations (Suno, AgentMail, KicksDB, weather, …) use configurable base URLs in `.env.example`; upstream hosts may return `402` for wallet-paid calls.
- Network: `testnet` and `mainnet` (UI labels; Arc chain id **5042002** for nanopayments)
- Payment rail: x402 style `charge` and `session` patterns
- Locus bridge: Laso Finance endpoints can be used for card issuance and status polling
- Status: Battle flow has a dedicated frontend; other use cases are implemented as backend scaffolds and/or demo interactions

## Environment and Networks

- Arc testnet
  - Chain ID: `42431`
  - Default currency: `pathUSD`
- mainnet
  - Chain ID: `4217`
  - Default currency: `USDC`

Network can be selected in the dedicated Battle frontend. Backend also accepts per-request `network` for battle endpoints.

### AgentMail relevance

- AgentMail is relevant to tournament operations for automated human notifications
  (call-time alerts, bracket delay warnings, judge room updates).
- It naturally complements the paid bot action write path by fan-outing operational
  messages to staff inboxes.
- Integration reference: [AgentMail docs](https://docs.agentmail.to/llms-full.txt)

### StablePhone relevance

- StablePhone is relevant for tournament operations because AI voice calls can handle urgent call-time reminders and live coordination tasks.
- It complements bot actions by adding direct phone outreach with transcript/status polling for auditability.
- Paid call initiation is x402/x402 and status polling is SIWX-authenticated wallet access.
- Integration reference: [StablePhone](https://stablephone.dev)

### StableSocial relevance

- StableSocial is relevant for ops and growth because teams can collect social profile intelligence for dancers, events, and fan campaigns.
- It complements tournament operations by enabling lightweight social monitoring workflows with token-based polling.
- Trigger calls are paid (x402/x402) and `/api/jobs` polling requires SIWX from the same wallet that paid.
- Integration reference: [StableSocial](https://stablesocial.dev)

### StableTravel relevance

- StableTravel is relevant for tournament operations where organizers coordinate travel for dancers, judges, and crew.
- It fits as a paid machine-to-machine API call pattern aligned with x402-style rails.
- Integration reference: [StableTravel API](https://stabletravel.dev/llms.txt)

### Aviationstack relevance

- Aviationstack is relevant for tournament operations because ops teams need live flight status and schedule intelligence.
- It complements StableTravel search by enriching logistics with status tracking for arrivals, delays, and gate windows.
- Integration reference: [Aviationstack API docs](https://docs.apilayer.com/aviationstack/docs/api-documentation?utm_source=AviationstackHomePage&utm_medium=Referral)

### Google Maps relevance

- Google Maps is relevant for tournament operations because crews need accurate venue coordinates, route planning, and dispatch precision.
- It complements flight and hotel flows by turning raw addresses into reliable geospatial data for logistics tooling.
- Integration reference: [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps)
- Reference gateway host (maps): [googlemaps.mpp.tempo.xyz](https://googlemaps.mpp.tempo.xyz)

### OpenWeather relevance

- OpenWeather is relevant to tournament operations because weather conditions impact travel windows, call times, and safety.
- It complements travel routing by adding real-time environmental context for venue and transport decisions.
- Dedicated wallet-paid UI: **`/weather`** → `POST /api/travel/openweather/current` → x402 **`POST /openweather/current-weather`** JSON body `{ lat, lon, units? }` (not legacy GET `/data/2.5/weather`).
- Integration reference: [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org)
- Reference gateway host (OpenWeather): [weather.mpp.paywithlocus.com](https://weather.mpp.paywithlocus.com)

- It helps ops and growth teams price drops, target inventory, and tailor tier benefits using product and pricing data.
- Integration reference: [KicksDB docs](https://docs.kicks.dev/llms-full.txt)
- Reference gateway host (KicksDB): [kicksdb.mpp.tempo.xyz](https://kicksdb.mpp.tempo.xyz)

## Neighbourhood health plan (OpenEHR + Arc USDC + artificial HES + SNOMED CT)

**Intent:** **openEHR** (EHRbase) for structured clinical access (AQL via BFF), **synthetic artificial HES** for LSOA-style aggregates (SQLite), **SNOMED CT** reference concepts (browser links + optional hooks in API responses), **Arc Testnet** + **USDC** **x402** nanopayments, optional **Featherless** narrative. **Not** a validated clinical model — artificial HES does not preserve field relationships. SNOMED tooling org: [IHTSDO on GitHub](https://github.com/IHTSDO); browse codes in the [SNOMED International Browser](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/).

### API mapping

- `GET /api/neighbourhood/insights/context` — Unpaid: integration narrative (OpenEHR, payments, sample data, SNOMED references with browser URLs).
- `GET /api/neighbourhood/insights/health` — SQLite row counts + EHRbase reachability probe (unpaid).
- `POST /api/neighbourhood/insights/lsoa` — Paid (when `NHS_ENABLE_PAYMENT_GATE=true`): AE aggregates by LSOA (or top LSOAs); includes `snomedCt.references` for demos.
- `POST /api/neighbourhood/insights/summary` — Paid: LLM summary via **Featherless** (`FEATHERLESS_API_KEY` on server); prompt includes SNOMED + openEHR framing.
- `POST /api/openehr/query/aql` — Paid: body `{ q: "AQL..." }` proxied to **EHRbase** (`EHRBASE_*` env).
- `GET /api/openehr/health` — EHRbase probe (unpaid).
- `POST /api/circle-modular` — JSON-RPC proxy to Circle Modular SDK (for `VITE_CIRCLE_CLIENT_KEY` flows).
- `GET /api/snomed/health` — Optional [Snowstorm](https://github.com/IHTSDO/snowstorm) probe (`SNOWSTORM_URL`, default `http://localhost:8081` if using bundled compose).
- `GET /api/snomed/lookup/:conceptId` — FHIR `CodeSystem/$lookup` via Snowstorm (requires SNOMED loaded server-side).

### Data ingest

- `npm run ingest:hes` with `HES_SAMPLE_DIR` pointing at the artificial **AE** CSV folder.

### Hackathon volume

- With payment gate off: `npm run burst:hackathon` hits the LSOA endpoint repeatedly for load smoke tests. For **on-chain** evidence, use the live wallet + Gateway flows in the UI.

## Notes and Next Iterations

- Current implementation is scaffold-first and uses in-memory storage.
- Receipts are mock receipts for local flow testing.
- Recommended next step:
  - persist records in a DB,
  - add auth/roles,
  - add webhook signature and retry handling for asynchronous settlement paths.
